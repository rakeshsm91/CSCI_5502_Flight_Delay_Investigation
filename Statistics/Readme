To understand the basic statistics of flight delays, we are plotting the below Graphs:

1. Airline vs Number of Delays wrt threshold 15min  -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise
2. Airline vs Number of Delays wrt Threshold 30min  -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise

3. Total Number of delays with threshold 15min -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise
4. Total Number of delays with threshold 30min -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise

5. Airport Arrival vs Number of Delays with threshold 15min  -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise
6. Airport Arrival vs Number of Delays with threshold 30min  -- Monthly wise, Yearly wise
